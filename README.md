# Unreal Tournament 2004 Mods
  
  This is my attempt at crowdsourcing as many UT2k4 maps, characters, or mods as possible.
  
  The idea spawned from our desire of playing UT2k4 in our office and managing our own local repository of collected maps and characters.
  
  During all of this, we found out that there is no complete "map pack" of everything. It's a long and tedious process to collect everything and install it.
  
  Now, our Unreal folder is managed via git so we can all keep up to date with new additions.

## Directions
  
  Please fork and add your own mods and submit a pull request. Let's make this repository as comprehensive as possible.

## Installation
  
  Currently, the easiest way is to clone this repository directly into your application folder. I will probably be writing a simple installer to make this process easier.

### Mac
  * Clone to /Applications/Unreal Tournament 2004.app/

### Windows
  * Clone to _can someone supply the correct directory?_

## Thanks / Credits
  
  I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to these maps and characters. Unfortunately, during our collections, the sources have been lost and the actual credits have been mislocated. If you're an author and would like credit, please message me and we'll put together a Wiki page thanking everyone.
